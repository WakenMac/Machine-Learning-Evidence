# HomePiano: A Comparative Study between the Efficiency of Random Forest and Support Vector Machines in a Monocular Augmented Reality Piano Hand-Key Detection Program.

This project is made to build an Augmented Reality (AR) piano using a mix of OpenCV's ArUco and MediaPipe to detect hands and piano on a video feed, as well as Random Forests and Support Vector Machines to predict key presses.

## Features

-   Hand Detection
-   Piano Key Playing
-   Key Press or Hover Differentiation

## Limitations

-   Only supports the top-down view of the piano
-   Requires sufficient lighting for the detection of ArUco markers
-   ArUco markers must not be covered
